# Photo Renamer
Are you tired of finding pictures of yourself after a vacation in a photo dump? Why not rename the images based on the people in the photos?

# How it Works
- Prepare Training Data: Make folders of the people who might appear in the photos in the training folder. Add 5-10 pictures of each person.

- Train the Model: Run the script to train the facial recognition model using the images in the training folder.

- Rename Images: Once the model is trained, simply provide a folder containing images. The script will detect faces in the images and rename them based on the recognized individuals.
